# Sonar-Drive-Bot
Arduino robot which drives by checking distances on three sides of the chassis.

The robot is built with 3D printed parts which I designed and a couple of servo motors.

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE.

I plan to:
  Make to arduino code fully functional
  Add images and .stl files of the parts
